# Foodborne Outbreaks
- 48 million people get sick each year in the United States
- 128,000 hospitalizations
- 3,000 deaths
- Medical terminology: gastroenteritis
- Lay term: food poisoning
- Can be caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites
- Treatment is typically supportive, meaning oral or intravenous hydration; antibiotics is typically not required but may be helpful if hospitalization is required

- Salmonella is the cause of typhoid, and was the subject of a well-known epidemiologic study that traced numerous outbreaks to Mary Mallon AKA Typhoid Mary in New York in the early 20th century
- Norovirus is well-known for causing gastroenteritis on cruise ships
- Staphylococcus aureus
    - Commonly known as ‘Staph infection,’ especially if it occurs on the skin
    - Named MRSA if it is resistant to methicillin, an antibiotic in the penicillin family
- Escherichia coli is also known as E. coli
- Shigella is the most common cause of dysentery, or bloody diarrhea

- Listeria causes both the highest absolute and relative number of fatalities
- Mycotoxins are fungal-derived toxins that can pass through the food chain without being degraded by digestion
- Botulism primarily affects infants who don’t yet have a full complement gut flora
- Cholera infections are highly correlated with sanitation

- Rotavirus is common among children
    - Young people have high resilience so may be more advanced disease at the time of presentation
    - No curative treatment available
- Listeria can cause meningitis in newborns, and pregnant women are advised to avoid unpasteurized dairy
