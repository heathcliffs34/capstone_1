- Salmonella is the cause of typhoid, and was the subject of a well-known epidemiologic study that traced numerous outbreaks to Mary Mallon AKA Typhoid Mary in New York in the early 20th century
- Norovirus is well-known for causing gastroenteritis on cruise ships
- Staphylococcus aureus
    - Commonly known as ‘Staph infection,’ especially if it occurs on the skin

- Escherichia coli is also known as E. coli
- Shigella is the most common cause of dysentery, or bloody diarrhea


![Mortality](https://github.com/heathcliffs34/capstone_1/blob/master/figures/present/mortality_and_rate.png)
- Listeria causes both the highest absolute and relative number of fatalities
- Mycotoxins are fungal-derived toxins that can pass through the food chain without being degraded by digestion
- Botulism primarily affects infants who don’t yet have a full complement gut flora
- Cholera infections are highly correlated with sanitation
